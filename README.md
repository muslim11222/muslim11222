### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Muslim
#### WordPress Plugin Developer


I am an experienced WordPress plugin developer with over 2 years of hands-on experience in developing custom plugins using PHP and WordPress standards. I have successfully published two plugins on the official WordPress.org repository:

1. "Contact Popover" â€“ A simple and customizable popover display plugin.
2. "Kids English Alphabet Pronunciation" â€“ An educational plugin designed for kids to learn English alphabets with sound, visuals, and examples.

In addition to developing plugins, I actively contribute to the WordPress.org community as a Translation Contributor, helping localize plugins and themes for Bengali-speaking users. My work reflects clean coding practices, OOP principles, and a deep understanding of WordPress hooks, actions, shortcodes, and admin UI customization.
I am passionate about building useful, user-friendly plugins that follow WordPress guidelines and enhance the user experience.

Skills:  HTML / CSS / JAVASCRIPT / PHP / PHP OOP /
